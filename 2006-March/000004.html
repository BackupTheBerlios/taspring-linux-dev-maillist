<PRE>I've compiled up spring from SVN without a problem and I can start, play 
the Random Enemies script without issue (apart from being thoroughly 
pasted by the Korgoths :-) ). But despite much googling around, I can't 
work out how to make the AI actually work.

This is an AMD64 box btw running Ubuntu Breezy.

I've been trying to get the JCAI up and running. It complained about 
various files being absent, such as xtapev7.cfg. Having found a copy of 
xtapev7.cfg in the AAI 0.55 release, it then complained about unexpected 
characters like '.' - it would complain about lines like

MIN_EFFICIENCY 0.1

So I went through the xtapev7.cfg removing all the floating point 
numbers (rounding them down to the nearest integer). Still nothing - 
when I try and start the game using an AI script, it complains

Log started on: Tuesday, March 07, day 066 of 2006.
The time is 08:07 PM.
Running mod xtapev3.sd7 on map SmallDivide.smf
No sideinfo node found in config file
MapInfo: 16x16, GameStateInfo: 8x8

Extractor Radius: 25.000000, mapblockw=6, metalblockw=6
Blocks: 16x16, Numspots=25, AverageProduction=78.693161
No info for side of CORCOM

And nothing seems to happen after that - I can see a Red Commander in 
the bottom right of the map if I wander over there but he's not doing 
very much. The other AIs seem to provide similar behaviour (although the 
NTAI will pursue me if I wander into range, he won't build anything...).

So - I must be screwing up somewhere. If someone could please explain 
how to get an AI game running, that would be great :-)

Thanks,
Toby Haynes
