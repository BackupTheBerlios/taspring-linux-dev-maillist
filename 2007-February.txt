My name is John, aka QMan, and I've been working on a Spring AI for a
while now.  In working on this, I've stumbled on a minor issue:

The engine only assigns a YardMap to units classified as a "Factory" or
"Building", however, units such as Metal Extractors (classified as
"MetalExtractor") and Nano Towers (classified as "Builder" aren't
classified as either of these types, and as such, are given a fully
transparent (non-blocking) yardmap.  This causes some weird issues for
the CanBuildAt function in AICallback.  Since these buildings have no
blocking yardmap, the CanBuildAt function returns true when something
tries to build on top of one of these buildings, and the Construction
Unit attempts to wait for the non-blocking building to move out of the
way (since it thinks it is a mobile unit).  I propose a simple fix to
this, as detailed below:

In UnitDefHandler.cpp @ line 576

Change line:
if(ud.type=="Building" || ud.type=="Factory"){

To:
if(ud.speed == 0){


Thanks!
