Hey,

i just joined the list. I'm looking to help out with testing and
possibly help out with some of the coding.

I'm running a AMD 64 X2 machine with Gentoo on it.

I look forward to helping out.

We do not yet use this list. Most discussion takes place in
Taspring-linux at lolut.utbm.info
http://lolut.utbm.info/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/taspring-linux

There were discussion about moving everything here. Nothing came out
of that. Nonetheless nearly all devs are supposed to be subscribed here.

You can also meet some of the people on IRC: #taspring on irc.freenode.net

Hi. Well, refer to my last two posts on gentoo.org:
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-410834-start-50.html.

I'm pretty sure this problem is caused by you not having the new mod
files. And there's also the second problem with the loading screen pictures.
You can fix both manually for now, I'll update the ebuild as soon as I can.
